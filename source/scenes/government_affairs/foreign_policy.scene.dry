= The Russian Invasion of Ukraine

Panic in the Cabinet! The russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a "Special Millitary Operation" in Ukraine to demillitarize and "de-nazify" the Country. Moments after the Announcement the Russian Army began a full-on round Invasion with large-scale Missile strikes both against the Millitary and Civillian Population. Already thousands have died, with Millions now trying to flee the Country. The Chancellor has called in an emergency Meeting, to discuss our options. While our Coalition Partners are supportive of help to Ukraine, they have some qualms about burning diplomatic relations and crossing "red lines". What should we do?

The key to peace in Europe is a rapproachment between France and Germany. We are taking steps towards that rapproachment. [? if young_plan_seen == 0 : This is difficult to do when France is occupying a major portion of Germany's territory, but we are working on that part. ?]

We also aim to improve relations with our eastern neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia, who are righfully terrified of German aggression. Hopefully we can convince them of our peaceful intentions.

The Soviet Union also suffered from the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles; they have been participating in our secret rearmament program. The Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 affirmed our friendly relations.

The Soviets are asking for economic and developmental assistance. They are still a poor country on the whole, and are desperately trying to catch up to the western powers. There is a chance that our anti-communist coalition partners would be upset, but we could assuage them by asking the Soviets for secret assistance in training and equiping the Reichswehr.

- @soviet_economic_aid_yes_mil: Provide aid, in exchange for Reichswehr assistance.

The Soviets are slightly upset, but they seemed to expect this answer.

We also mention the KPD in our conversations with the Soviet ambassador. They claim that the KPD is entirely independent of the Soviet government, and that the conflict is Thälmann's doing. But, soon after our conversation we notice a slight improvement in attitudes from the KPD.

Of course Stalin and the various leaders of the Comintern know about the Wittorf Affair, but they do not seem to know that we know as well. The Comintern was planning to build a narrative around the affair that absolves Thälmann, but perhaps now they will be less inclined to defend him.

The right has long desired closer ties with Austria, with the eventual goal of the merger of the two German-speaking countries. A customs union with Austria is the first step towards this goal. Additionally, many believe that a union with Austria would improve our current economic circumstances.

However, the Allies, especially France, are likely to object. This agreement would break the terms of the Versailles Treaty, and could lead to economic sanctions, further hurting our economy.

- @customs_union_2: Yes, do it!

We have formed a customs union with Austria! The right-wing parties are praising us for this unexpected turn of events.

Immediately, France and other neighboring countries lodge their protests. The longer-term response is yet to be seen.

Negotiations procede smoothly for the most part. The Western powers are convinced of Germany's sincerity and goodwill. [? if nationalism <= 50 or pacifism >= 3 : They are pleased to see that we are renouncing militarism. ?]

Finally, given both the economic circumstances and our continued negotiations, the Western Allies are willing to pause our reparations payments! Much of the credit must go to American president Hoover, who has been friendlier towards us than the Europeans.

This has reduced tensions within our government, and our party has gotten credit for the achievement.

The previous foreign ministry, despite its benevolent and peaceful face, was secretly helping the Reichswehr to build up its forces, in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles.

The Allies are grateful of our exposure and repudiation of militarism. Our partners in the coalition are less supportive.

The Roman Catholic Church is interested in furthering relations with the German Republic, seeing us as preferable to the old anti-Catholic policies of the Empire. We are working towards the signing of a Concordat, an agreement between the Vatican and the Republic that formally recognizes the Church's rights and interests in the country. The Center Party is especially interested in making this agreement.

[? if family_law : Our liberalized divorce policies make it difficult to build relations with the Vatican. ?] [? if abortion : Our legalization of abortion make it difficult to connect with the Church. ?]

We have successfully signed a Concordat between Germany and the Roman Catholic Church!

Forming a "United States of Europe" has long been part of the Social Democratic foreign program. Finally, we are taking steps towards it. Given our positive relations with the other countries of Europe, we can begin to hold multilateral negotiations for more European federalism. It will take time to hammer out the exact shape of this future "European Union", however.

achievement: eu

Along with France, Great Britain, and many other states of Western and Eastern Europe, we have signed a treaty to form a European Union! It is hoped that Europe has learned the lessons of the Great War; never again will there be another war that tears the continent apart.

A major component of the union is the free movement of people and goods across the countries of Europe, as well as the stabilization of currency exchange rates. This provides new markets for German products and new sources of investment.

Fascist Italy remains a problem, and the Soviet Union also lies outside the system. But for now, there is new hope for peace and prosperity throughout the continent.
